Package Management
🔹 1. Updating Package Index (Debian/Ubuntu)

Before installing anything, always refresh the list of available packages:

sudo apt update

This doesn’t install updates — it just fetches the latest package info from repositories.

🔹 2. Installing Packages

On Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt install nginx


On CentOS/RedHat:

sudo yum install nginx

🔹 3. Removing Packages

Debian/Ubuntu:

sudo apt remove nginx


CentOS/RedHat:

sudo yum remove nginx

💡 If you want to remove config files too (Debian/Ubuntu):
sudo apt purge nginx

🔹 4. Updating/Upgrading Installed Software

On Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt upgrade


On CentOS/RedHat:
sudo yum update

🔹 5. Checking Logs

Most Linux logs are stored in /var/log/.
Examples:
System log: /var/log/syslog (Ubuntu/Debian) or /var/log/messages (RedHat).
Authentication log: /var/log/auth.log
Package manager logs:
 Ubuntu: /var/log/apt/

less /var/log/syslog
  Opens the syslog file in read-only mode with the pager less
  can scroll up and down
  useful to view old logs

tail -f /var/log/syslog
  Shows the last 10 lines of the log file.
  while -f stream live log entries
  Good for real-time monitoring

NGINX is a service (managed by systemd)

A service is a program that runs in the background, usually managed by systemd.
A process is an actual running instance of a program
When you start Nginx, it launches processes to handle web requests.
 You can see them with:
ps aux | grep nginx

ps -- process status.
  Used to view running processes on your system.

ps aux
➡️ Shows all running processes in detail.

ps aux | grep nginx
This filters the process list to show only lines with "nginx".

apt -- It’s the package manager used in Debian-based systems like Ubuntu.
Installs, updates, upgrades, removes software.
Basically, apt is your software app store in the terminal.

apt update → refresh the package list (so your system knows the latest versions).
apt upgrade → upgrade installed packages to newer versions.
apt install nginx → install NGINX package.
apt remove nginx → remove NGINX but keep config files.
apt purge nginx → remove NGINX and its config files.
apt search nginx → search for a package.
apt show nginx → show details about a package.
